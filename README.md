## take note ##  
- full screen on ios is not supported  
- if u are using a touch device and u find that the player runs off in one direction, that is because rather than picking your finger up of the button, u slid it off. Simply just retap the button and he will stop.  
- pause will reset player to start of level  
- could add a option to turn of visibility of LRJ keys
